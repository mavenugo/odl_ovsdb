OVERVIEW
========
This distribution is built to allow to deploy all the commons parents
in one shot. This is needed because the way how maven works when a
"mvn deploy" is called on a multi-module project, only the modules
that are listed in there are deployed. All the opendaylight modules
has a parent, those parents module will not be deployed when deploying
a distribution hence if someone tries to compile a module without
compiling the whole system it will run in missing parent errors.
To address the issue this distribution will collect all the known
parents and deploy them in one shot.

The user of this distribution is one of the Jenkins jobs and not
developers.
